        Hi Gabe, I would love to thank you for everything! ❤️I honestly can
        not imagine a better and more 'go above and beyond to help us' person
        to teach us web development. Thanks to your beautiful drawings 🎨 and
        detailed explanations I understood concepts, that otherwise would be
        hard to understand. And thanks to your propaganda, I became a
        developer who loves to use linter, tries to always built reusable
        components, uses styled-components, loves to use debugger and tests
        the code. 💻 And the most importantly, always uses Postman first! 🚀

        Gabe, you blew my mind with your ability to explain complicated topics
        and take away layers and layers of abstraction, so we can understand
        what is really going on under the hood. Your lectures were amazing and
        you were always full of energy ⚡. I appreciate your debugger
        propaganda which was a life saver! Future Lambda students are in for a
        treat!🔥

        Cheers Gabe! Pair programming together in project week was a highlight
        for me - it very much reinforced your propaganda segment about the
        value of working with a senior! All the best for the future.

        Gabe, you said in week 1 that you were jealous of the position we were
        in and that we should make sure we had fun learning the ropes. Now I
        know why. There was no better way to approach what seemed like a
        daunting arena, than with you as an instructor. Gabe Propoganda™ and
        Gabe Sketches ™ have been real. Thanks for going beyond the curriculum
        and pushing us to do things the right way. Cheers Gabe! 🍻

        Whether it was brainwashing us with propaganda or spending two hours
        debugging a particularly tricky piece of code, you were always there
        for us! Thanks to you, we’ll never be able to look at Postman in quite
        the same way. Gabe, thanks for everything you’ve done for us in the
        past 15 weeks. You are by far the favorite teacher I’ve had in my
        life. (And that includes three miserable years in college 😂 )

        Ciao Gabe, The first thing I want to say is that I loved your
        propaganda moments. I was always eager for them as they was funny and
        insightful, that is in my opinion the best way to learn something. I
        also loved the way you taught us concepts in the easiest way possible,
        without going directly to the code, but just pushing over and over on
        the abstraction itself. It was really helpful to be able to really
        understand the concept before trying to apply it. I really believe we
        were lucky to have you as an instructor! A big, big Thank You!

        Hey Gabe 👋 Thanks so much for your instruction over the last 15
        weeks. You've been an awesome teacher and have always gone beyond the
        call of duty. You answer questions quickly and providing your own
        opinion on topics. I've really enjoyed the whole web course and really
        appreciate all the extra bits of information you've provided along the
        way. I've particularly enjoyed the way you take the time to explain
        principals rather than just demoing code, the analogies and
        explanations have been awesome and really helped my understanding.
        Cheers for everything!! xox

        Hello Gabe, having you as an instructor this past 3 months has been
        absolutely amazing, I started knowing the most basic JS and being kind
        of scared of the curriculum for the upcoming months. Now I feel I
        could actually learn so much more on my own and this is for the most
        part thanks to you and your lectures (and the sketches!!) Muchísimas
        gracias por todo y buena suerte para el futuro! 🙂

        express how good your lessons were, always trying to improve and push
        us over the limit, felling so lucky that I took a part of them. Thanks
        for all the debug sessions and advise from the build week, it helped

        Hola Gabe! These weeks have been amazing and your way of teaching
        concepts have been the best I have seen. You did it so easily that for
        a total beginner like me learning to code seemed not difficult. Muchas
        gracias por todo! Te has convertido en uno de mis profesores favoritos

        Gabe, thank you for all of the effort you made to teach us and bring
        us to where we are today! I am immensely grateful for your tremendous
        support and willingness to go above and beyond and introduce us to new
        materials and concepts with every lecture. I hope many more Lambda

        Hi Gabe! Thank you so much for all your hard work and dedication
        during the past 15 weeks. I loved how you always pushed us to do learn
        things that were beyond the curriculum. Your drawings (though
        sometimes crazy) were very informative and entertaining. I remember
        the first time you set up a React App without CRA, and I thought to
        myself "damn, this guy is a wizard" 🧙. I also liked all your quirks,
        like how you'd always point at the camera 👉📹, spill out propaganda
        and tell us to use postman first. I wish all the best luck for you in
        the future, thank you for helping all of us in this journey. ✨

        I can count on my fingers the amount of teachers or mentors that have
        had such a profound impact on my life and learning, and all I can say
        is Gabe you are amazing! Your willingness to go above and beyond for
        us and to push us further than we could have imagined; you are truly a
        living, breathing gift to all those that you teach. From your
        delightfully quotable code propaganda to your detailed diagrams and
        explanations, what more could a student ask for in a mentor? You truly
        are our code wizard sensei 🧙🏼‍️ I am so grateful. Thank you! ✨
