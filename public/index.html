          Hi Gabe, I would love to thank you for everything! ❤️I honestly can
          not imagine a better and more 'go above and beyond to help us' person
          to teach us web development. Thanks to your beautiful drawings 🎨 and
          detailed explanations I understood concepts, that otherwise would be
          hard to understand. And thanks to your propaganda, I became a
          developer who loves to use linter, tries to always built reusable
          components, uses styled-components, loves to use debugger and tests
          the code. 💻 And the most importantly, always uses Postman first! 🚀

          Gabe, you blew my mind with your ability to explain complicated topics
          and take away layers and layers of abstraction, so we can understand
          what is really going on under the hood. Your lectures were amazing and
          you were always full of energy ⚡. I appreciate your debugger
          propaganda which was a life saver! Future Lambda students are in for a
          treat!🔥

          Cheers Gabe! Pair programming together in project week was a highlight
          for me - it very much reinforced your propaganda segment about the
          value of working with a senior! All the best for the future.

          Gabe, you said in week 1 that you were jealous of the position we were
          in and that we should make sure we had fun learning the ropes. Now I
          know why. There was no better way to approach what seemed like a
          daunting arena, than with you as an instructor. Gabe Propoganda™ and
          Gabe Sketches ™ have been real. Thanks for going beyond the curriculum
          and pushing us to do things the right way. Cheers Gabe! 🍻

          Whether it was brainwashing us with propaganda or spending two hours
          debugging a particularly tricky piece of code, you were always there
          for us! Thanks to you, we’ll never be able to look at Postman in quite
          the same way. Gabe, thanks for everything you’ve done for us in the
          past 15 weeks. You are by far the favorite teacher I’ve had in my
          life. (And that includes three miserable years in college 😂 )

          Ciao Gabe, The first thing I want to say is that I loved your
          propaganda moments. I was always eager for them as they was funny and
          insightful, that is in my opinion the best way to learn something. I
          also loved the way you taught us concepts in the easiest way possible,
          without going directly to the code, but just pushing over and over on
          the abstraction itself. It was really helpful to be able to really
          understand the concept before trying to apply it. I really believe we
          were lucky to have you as an instructor! A big, big Thank You!
