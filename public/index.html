          Hi Gabe, I would love to thank you for everything! ❤️I honestly can
          not imagine a better and more 'go above and beyond to help us' person
          to teach us web development. Thanks to your beautiful drawings 🎨 and
          detailed explanations I understood concepts, that otherwise would be
          hard to understand. And thanks to your propaganda, I became a
          developer who loves to use linter, tries to always built reusable
          components, uses styled-components, loves to use debugger and tests
          the code. 💻 And the most importantly, always uses Postman first! 🚀

          Gabe, you blew my mind with your ability to explain complicated topics
          and take away layers and layers of abstraction, so we can understand
          what is really going on under the hood. Your lectures were amazing and
          you were always full of energy ⚡. I appreciate your debugger
          propaganda which was a life saver! Future Lambda students are in for a
          treat!🔥

          Cheers Gabe! Pair programming together in project week was a highlight
          for me - it very much reinforced your propaganda segment about the
          value of working with a senior! All the best for the future.

          Gabe, you said in week 1 that you were jealous of the position we were
          in and that we should make sure we had fun learning the ropes. Now I
          know why. There was no better way to approach what seemed like a
          daunting arena, than with you as an instructor. Gabe Propoganda™ and
          Gabe Sketches ™ have been real. Thanks for going beyond the curriculum
          and pushing us to do things the right way. Cheers Gabe! 🍻
