          Hi Gabe, I would love to thank you for everything! ❤️I honestly can
          not imagine a better and more 'go above and beyond to help us' person
          to teach us web development. Thanks to your beautiful drawings 🎨 and
          detailed explanations I understood concepts, that otherwise would be
          hard to understand. And thanks to your propaganda, I became a
          developer who loves to use linter, tries to always built reusable
          components, uses styled-components, loves to use debugger and tests
          the code. 💻 And the most importantly, always uses Postman first! 🚀

          Gabe, you blew my mind with your ability to explain complicated topics
          and take away layers and layers of abstraction, so we can understand
          what is really going on under the hood. Your lectures were amazing and
          you were always full of energy ⚡. I appreciate your debugger
          propaganda which was a life saver! Future Lambda students are in for a
          treat!🔥 
          <p class="msg-text">Thank you!🙏🙏🙏</p>

          Cheers Gabe! Pair programming together in project week was a highlight 
          for me - it very much reinforced your propaganda segment about the value of working with a senior! 
          All the best for the future.
